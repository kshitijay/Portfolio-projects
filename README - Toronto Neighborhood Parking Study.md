Toronto Neighborhood Parking Study

This project analyzes parking availability and infractions across Toronto neighbourhoods using data from the Urban HEART@Toronto initiative (based on WHO’s Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool).
The goal was to uncover trends in parking violations, identify high-risk areas, and explore the relationship between parking spaces and infractions to inform city planning and neighbourhood equity (NEI) assessments.

🗂️ Dataset

Source: Urban HEART@Toronto research initiative
Scope:
239 parking lots across 79 neighbourhoods
1.4 million+ infraction records (types, fines, timestamps)
Data cleaning & transformation performed using Power Query

🛠️ Tools & Techniques

Power Query → Data cleaning, ETL, and preprocessing
Power BI → Interactive dashboards and visualizations
Geospatial Analysis → Mapping infractions across Toronto neighbourhoods

📊 Dashboards Created

Parking Availability Dashboard – Current distribution of parking lots across neighbourhoods.
Infraction Analysis Dashboard – Total infractions and most common violation types by neighbourhood.
Parking vs Infractions Correlation Dashboard – Explored relationship between parking lot availability and infractions, revealing a non-linear pattern where fewer parking spaces are linked to higher infraction counts.

🔑 Key Insights

Neighbourhoods with limited parking availability show disproportionately higher infractions, highlighting infrastructure inequity.
Fine collections vary significantly across neighbourhoods, indicating potential socio-economic disparities.
Insights can guide urban planners and policymakers to optimize parking management, reduce infractions, and improve NEI scores.

📂 Portfolio Value

This project demonstrates skills in:
Large-scale data analysis (1.4M+ records)
ETL and data modeling with Power Query
Interactive dashboarding and geospatial visualization with Power BI
Translating data into actionable recommendations for city planning and equity assessment
